# About this Repo

This is a GeoJSON subfolder split of the [nvkelso/natural-earth-vector](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector) package, that provides "A global, public domain map dataset available at three scales and featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data."

## Why?

When only the GeoJSON files are needed in a project, it is either necessary to download all the individual files on the [website](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) or to check out the entire repository, which is about 10GB. This subfolder split limits the download size to 700MB.
